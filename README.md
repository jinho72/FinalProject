# FinalProject

This is the repository for my final project.
My final project is an interactive game inspired by my own experience at Seoul subway stations.
During busy hours, people tend to miss trains because there are so many people.
Your goal is to get as many people on the platform inside the train!
Make sure you don't put in the ones that are waiting for the next train.
